# Culturally-Grounded-MIR


**Culturally-Grounded-MIR** is a curated, open-source library of research papers, datasets, and computational models dedicated to the analysis and generation of non-Western and folk music traditions.

Standard MIR algorithms often rely on assumptions from Western tonal music (12-tone equal temperament, 4/4 time, harmonic focus). This repository centralizes research that tackles the unique challenges of global music systems, including **microtonality**, **non-isochronous rhythms**, **modal evolution**, and **oral traditions**.

## 🎯 Project Goals

1.  **Centralization:** Provide a "one-stop shop" for researchers entering culturally specific MIR.
2.  **Dataset Discovery:** Direct links to "low-resource" datasets (like SymbTr, CompMusic, or Saraga).
3.  **Benchmarking:** Track the performance of state-of-the-art models (Transformers, LSTMs, CNNs) on non-Western corpora.
4.  **Bias Mitigation:** Highlight papers that specifically address Western-centric bias in AI music tools.
